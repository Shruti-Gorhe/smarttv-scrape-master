      aiReviewSummary: `
        Based on customer reviews, this TV offers excellent picture quality with vibrant colors and sharp 4K resolution. 
        Most users praise the smart features and user-friendly interface, though some mentioned slight lag during streaming. 
        The sound quality is good but not exceptional, with several reviewers recommending a soundbar for the best experience. 
        Setup is straightforward and the TV represents good value for money in this price range. 
        Some customers noted that the remote control could be more intuitive. Overall satisfaction is high with 85% of 
        reviewers rating it 4 stars or above.
